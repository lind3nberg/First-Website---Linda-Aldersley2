<h2 class="hi">Hi!</h2> <br>
<p>Thanks for taking some time to visit my first ever website. 
My name's Linda, I'm 23 from Watford living in North West London. 
I'm obsessed with all things related to science, nature, food and beauty. 

My mum is from Brazil so I'm continuously learning to better my Portuguese skills; I'm also teaching myself Spanish. 

I'm on a three week coding course with Code Nation where I'm learning how to use both front end and back end languages to create this very site!

I have used HTML and CSS for this site, and in the second week, I helped create a text based adventure game using Python.</p>
<br>

<p> Throughout my life, computers and the whole tech world was a mystery to me. 
My family delayed in getting a computer until I was 14, everyone at school was talking about MSN and Club Penguin and I felt sad that my only form of communication with my friends was calling them on their land line! <br>
I struggled a lot in my IT classes at school- shout out to Jananee who I sat next to, she would never get impatient with me tapping her shoulder every other second because I had no idea what was going on! <br>
The humiliation of my ineptitude with tech caused me to steer clear from learning anything more than creating a new email address that said I was 16 just so I could make a Facebook account. 
<br>

I digress, it took me a long time to transition my attitude of being intimidated by tech, to being curious about how all this stuff on a screen was made. 
<br> <br>
Fast forward to the year 2020, I've dropped out of the first year Psychology degree this year; although I love the subject deeply, I seemed to be allergic to the style of learning. Ever since, I have been exploring and experimenting with things I'd like to learn more about. Coding was one of them. 

I began teaching myself C, using free online rescources mostly on youtube and with their help, made some incredibly simple projects, like building a calculator. I was so proud of myself! I loved the instantaneous feedback you get from clicking the play button the text editor. If it would run, great! If not it was fun to play around and see what works and what didn't. The idea of getting better at coding and making something bigger and better was also a goal I wanted to achieve. <br>
I thought of the possibilities, I could make such stupid and fun projects! <br>
I couldn't wait to learn more.
<br>


I didn't get very far with learning C as I recieved an email from Universal Credit, telling me about some courses they were offering, one of which, being a coding course with Code Nation. So obviously I jumped at the oppertunity.

<h2> Why Coding? </h2>
</div>

<div class="why-code-text">
<p> Coding has become a new outlet for my creativity. I'm  excited to better my skills and to learn even more about both front-end and back-end developing. I will continue to build on the skills I have learnt during the course and would love to become a a full stack web developer in time. I never thought I would find it so enjoyable and satisfying when you finally create what you had first invisaged. <br>
I love that coding allows for remote work- so it's possible to code from anywhere with a Wi-Fi connection. 
This way I can be travelling wherever I please and still earn an income. - who wouldn't ?
