<h2>Unit 1 - Outcome 1</h2>

<h3>1.1</h3>
 

<p>IT has allowed businesses to become more accessible, wherever you are on the planet. For companies big and small, getting products and services to be seen by a larger audience has never been so simple. Smaller businesses can pay a reasonable price to be advertised on social media sites such as Facebook, or you can send your product to one of Instagram's influencers, in the hope that they use your product and make posts, raving about it.
These platforms have been the catalyst for many small businesses to grow exponentially, which is the ideal situation for any business. Take the company GymShark for example, through savvy early  use of online fitness influencers and Youtubers, the company was a multimillion pound business within 6 years. 
The global visibility that social media, online stores and online advertising have given these businesses can mean the possibility of  faster growth. </p>

<h3>1.2</h3>


<p>To successfully complete a digital project, whether it's a website, game or an app, you must create a plan of the content/storyline etc. Tools like Trello are great for outlining a to-do list which follows a Kanban format, so when you've completed that task, you can easily keep track of what's still a work in progress, what's been done and what is still left to do. 
Depending on what type of project you're making, you will need to use different coding languages or a mixture of them, (Python for back end and CSS for front end.) You will also require someone on your team that posses those skills, or you will need them yourself if you are working individually. 

Communicating with your team is extremely important, keeping team mates updated with what you're doing and knowing what's going on their end will help in a few ways, here are three: 

1.If anyone's ahead of schedule, they can help out with anyone in need. 
2.Sharing new ideas/changes to the project.
3.Feedback on your own work and a different perspective on what you've done.

Even if you're working on your own, you need to ensure good communication with the client as you want to make sure you are fulfilling the brief as best as you possibly can. 

Having a team leader is also helpful, although not essential. It may be more beneficial for teams with less experience to have someone with more to act as a mentor and guide them in the right direction if having trouble.</p>

<br><br><br>

<h3>1.3</h3>


<p>When planning my website, I used good old fashion pen and paper to come up with ideas of what I wanted to include. After deciding on a hefty set of requirements which I later regret and and drastically simplified, I took to Trello to clearly define what I needed to do to complete the project. We had a week to complete the brief so everything was sheduled using the due date and time options on the Trello board to remind myself what needed to be done and when.
Then, to Vscode to outline the bones of the site (written content, title pages, images and a drab nav bar.)
It was so much simpler inputting what I had planned, instead of winging it and was good to have my Trello board to refer back to. This meant I could spend more time researching what I wanted to do in CSS.

<br><br><br>




<h3>1.4</h3>


<p>Digital projects may fail, firstly due to disagreement within the creative team; creative leaders butting heads can slow progress, delaying release and reducing the quality of the project.If the team is not all on board about the specifics of what the end goal is, and how they're going to get there, how are they supposed to collaborate effectively? In a survey conducted by the Harvard Business Review, this happened to Italian energy provider Sorgenia when planning action to reach their goal of providing energy to 1 million customers. Secondly, a project maybe hindered by lack of digital capabilities within the team, say if a company briefed their team to develop an attractive new website for the firm but the whole team were specialised back end developers with no experience with creating the aesthetics of a fresh new website! Maybe they would pull together to deliver something good, but it would not be of the same calibre of someone with front end skills. </p>






<br><br><br>






<h3>1.5</h3>


<p>For developing my projects so far, I have used the languages that I have most experience in. Although I have little and am not fully proficient in them, they have helped me achieve basic beginner projects that I'm very proud of. 
In a group work project, we created a text based adventure game with Python, we built the game's pathways and added minimal visual art and sound effects. I was surprised at how beginner friendly the language was and soon learned it was used to create google, instagram, a plethora of artificial intelligence and even NASA was using it in their operating systems. I'm glad I was introduced to  this language in particular, because of the variance in possible projects that can be created so it would definitely be one to consider in almost any project. 
For more front end projects such as a website, I would recommend using HTML and CSS, again because I hold some experience with them 
HTML is the skeleton of site, and was very simplistic and easy to use. CSS on the other hand, fleshes it out with positioning, colour and other graphics. I found CSS a little more complicated but it's only because I haven't spent as much time with it. 
With future projects I will probably stick to what I know and build my knowledge from the foundation that the Code Nation course has given me, rather than try and learn a different language altogether. Maybe I would in the future, but I feel there is a lot to be achieved and experimented with the three languages I studied. 
In terms of a text editor on which to build these projects, I have been using Vscode. 
With HTML and CSS I have experienced no issues so far in how my projects come out. 
With Python, my projects would not run for some reason and would run perfectly on my colleagues when I asked them to test it for me. I will be exploring other text editors for Python projects. </p>




<br><br><br>



<h3>1.6</h3>



<p>Using slack for communication between one another has been useful in keeping in contact with my team mates when working in a group, we used it to update each other on what we were all doing. We also used Zoom for this purpose and had daily stand ups with our team leader as covid-19 has forced the course to be all online. Without contact through these platforms we could not of communicated so fluidly and got things done in the time that we did . Using a Trello board for the group and myself individually was a great tool because had I not've used it I would have written a schedule in a diary, which with all the changes that were made would have made the notes unclear and incomprehensible where I could interpret the mess incorrectly. Trello's Kanban method of moving tasks into a done pile was very clear and showed you what was left to do in a neat, organised and scribble free environment that didn't leave you second guessing if you had done it or not. 
I have not used GitHub as of yet, however, I have read that once you post your code online, you can review a timeline of what changes have been added and when so you can track the evolution of the original piece. It looks really useful and my team should have used it to build our game as it would be clear for anyone looking at it to see who did which parts of the game. You can also communicate on there and assign tasks to your team and leave comments which would be useful for group projects. </p>


<br><br><br>


<h3>1.7</h3>



<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) operates in the UK and Europe and from May  2018, they introduced new regulations, designed to inhibit the misuse of personal data."Data" is anything that can identify a person, such as their phone number, email, photos and ip address. GDPR's impact on digital projects has meant that businesses have to take new measures in which to store, organise, protect and process customer data; also having available information to let the customer know how and what will happen to their data after it is harvested. Failure to comply with the rules can result in a fine upwards of a million pounds. This can be a problem for people that have made a website for their business and they are not aware of GDPR's guidelines, perhaps because they were teaching themselves from online resources and no one mentioned them. This can be problematic  if someone hacks into a non protected data base and steals and misuses the data. You will still be liable to be charged as you did not set up a safe environment of which to store customer data. </p>

<h2>Unit 1 - Outcome 2</h2>



<h3>2.1</h3>


<p>I had a really good experience with Visual Studio Code when making my website. I haven't used any other text editors so I don't have anything to compare it to but it was easy to navigate, I liked that you can have multiple windows of different languages open at the same time so you check between your CSS styling page. I had no issues in viewing my we page in the finder and loved how quick it was in updating changes with just a save a refresh. I would definitely like to explore some other text editors out there to compare but for now it is a very clear environment for which to set up a website- using python was another story but it may have been my laptop- WHO KNOWS?
With Trello, I had used it before so I was already aware of it's prestige,  I was happy to be familiar with at least one thing on the course! Very happy with how it was used in both the group project and my own website, mainly because of its clarity and ease. I think you can probably use it with any project and is a great tool for developers as you can just have a Trello window open the whole day and just peek at what's next on the list. 
</p> <br><br><br>


<h3>2.2</h3>



<p>The IT tools (VSCode and Trello) were appropriate as I learned that these tools will help me out later on with future projects. Already using some industry standard applications may help with settling into a job role in which they already use Trello and VSCcode. The course not only taught me how to code, but showed me some useful ways to organise my workload and get me familiar with how a text editor works. 
VsCode was a goof platform to have for a beginner as it already has so many languages installed and it was pretty easy to download Python and other additions. </p>
<br><br><br>


<h3>2.4</h3>
<p>Overall I'm happy with my project as a first try in making a website.
It is simplistic in format-I attempted to emulate something modern and sleek that I've seen before with some online modern shops. I wouldn't call it sleek by any means, it contains everything that was briefed: an about me page, all of Code Nation's written work and a  contact page. 
In my opinion, the home page resembles how a new mobile network's  would, with it's dreamy imagery and bold but friendly looking font.
Initially, I attempted to create a website about my experiences travelling with lots of pictures, a gallery and blog,but I bit off a lot more than I could chew and couldn't get it how I wanted it, then decided to scrap the lot. 
I am much happier with the latter, although its content is much less fun than I intended . I do like how it's not too busy, easy to navigate and I haven't used any obnoxious colours that would induce a migraine in any of my visitors.

If I could make any amendments to the project, I would love to make it more dynamic in the way the user interacts with the website; add some elegant swipe transition between page selection and enlarge the nav bar text as you hover over it. 
I would've also of liked to implement a enquiry form to the contact page that would send straight to my email.
</p>
<br><br><br>


<h3>2.5</h3>
<p>Whilst writing up my written coursework, I used a word document to answer each question for each unit, I used the web as a resource to gather references from (which you can see at the bottom of the page) and made sure the paragraphs written are proven correct via the reference links below. Once writing out the work - I have then formatted them into Visual Studio Code in the correct order, using HTML syntax to make sure the website is running to my liking with the information provided, along with the other features of my web site, such as: navigation bar, each web page correctly linked together, images, sections of the pages divided which will help me apply CSS styling to it to have an overall aesthetically pleasing website.
To ensure they match the requirements necessary, I saved each part of the code I wanted to create and apply, opened the web page in an internet browser and physically overlooked the changes made were to my liking and are fit for purpose. I will follow these steps and procedures until my website is fully completed.</p>

<h2>Unit 1 - Outcome 3</h2>

<h3>3.1</h3>
<p>I  could have been more efficient by sticking to my original idea and going with it, however, when I did change my idea to make a plan, Trello really helped me scope out a step by step visual guide of what I needed to do. A drawback from Trello in terms of efficiency and productivity is that I  could see what I needed to do, but in terms of priority or importance- that call was on me. My failure to identify which task was more important lead me to task hopping, where I would spend some time on one task- not complete it because I realised I needed to add something before the step I was trying to achieve. 
If we had worked in teams I believe the productivity levels would've been higher as you can focus your full attention on one part, but it would be strange to fill the brief as we are supposed to be making a website with our own details and putting our own individual spin on it. 
The slack channel was a really helpful tool as it gave access to our classmates and tutor for their knowledge and opinions. I feel like I should have utilised this tool sooner as I tried to work through some of the issues I was having and eventually gave in to ask for help later on.</p>
<br><br><br>

<h3>3.2</h3>
<p>My first advice to improve productivity and efficiency would be to fully utilise the tools already at your disposal. In this case, Slack and Trello. These  act as a map towards your end goal and should be referred to as much as possible. Sometimes that means badgering your tutor or classmates if you're not sure what's going on. It’s better to ask sooner rather than later!
When taking on a big project like making a website, you should track how much time you are spending on each tasks and allocate so much time to a task. This paired with regular breaks  can keep you from feeling drained and burnt out. The Pomodoro Method is an excellent example and I followed throughout my project; you set a timer for 25 minutes and work until time is up and then you have a 10 minute break to do whatever you want! I find this reduces the urge to look at distractions such as social media, messages because I know if I need to I can respond or scroll in my 10 minute break. I also found myself coming up with new ideas on my breaks so had new cool things to add to the project. </p>
<br><br><br>

<h3>3.3</h3>
<p>In my next project (To make a website for my small business) I will be sure to make use of tools like Trello and Slack. With Slack in particular I am determined to contact some of my classmates and ask for their opinion and help. I like this idea as we can work through a problem together and earn from one another, solidifying our knowledge through teaching it to someone else.
I would set number of hours each day to work on pre-allocated tasks in an incremental sequence, meaning that I would not be able to continue to the next task unless the last was completed. Organising the day this way means that I have designated time to focus on work and I can concentrate specifically on the task I have set myself, which for me, I feel will be less stressful than checking my Trello "to do" list and and trying to do everything at once in traditional Linda fashion. 
</p>
<br><br><br>

<h3>3.4</h3>
<p> To test a digital solution for let's say for example, the last question (Solutions to improve productivity) What better way to test them out but to design your own project and test out how the new resource helps the individual. You may want to select a sample of people that acknowledge that they have difficulties with their efficiency and productivity and get them to report back after the project. Much like these questions have asked of Trello abd Slack. </p>

<h2>Unit 2 - Outcome 1</h2>

<h3>2.1</h3>
<p>My home page consists of  large "Welcome" text to greet new visitors, with a sunset backdrop that continues throughout each page of the site. At the top left of the page is a navigation bar that blends into the photo backdrop and also continues in that same space throughout each page. When hovered over, the text lights up a pale green from black. 
The next page is my coursework page, consisting of, you guessed it!- coursework given to me by Code Nation. Here I have used several transparent boxes, holding each of the outcomes for each unit. To match the backdrop, I have used a peachy colour for the text. I have also used buttons to take you to each unit to make it easier for the user to navigate the written work, as there is a lot. 
Moving onto the about me page. It follows similar format to the coursework page, I think it would look aesthetically pleasing if everything mirrors each other neatly. I have another box, containing a bio about myself and how I came to my interests and ambitions in technology. I have used the same fonts/colour scheme as I have in mu other pages. The text is centred in the container with some padding to make it fit comfortably. 
My contact page is certainly the simplest of all my pages as it holds my email, and phone number for anyone that wishes to contact me from looking at my work . The text is centred in the middle of the page and is in a miniature box compared to the others. </p>
<br><br><br>

<h3>2.5</h3>
<p>Copyright  is a legal term, which means in order to use  a product(piece of music, images, research, articles, art) wherever you want, you must purchase the right to use that image for "x" number of years unless you are the creator of that product. An example of copyright infringement is downloading free music from sites that are not directly connected to the artist. The same goes with films, and other forms of digital media.  Other examples include seeing someone's art online and using their image to print T-shirts and claiming the design is your own. To avoid being sued, plenty of stock images exist to use instead or get int contact with the owner. If they are famous, you will usually have to cough up a lot of money. 
</p>
<br><br><br>

<h3>2.6</h3>
<p>Technology is seen in a great light in the medical field by enabling the less abled to do what  they wouldn't of been able to do before. Look at Stephen Hawking for instance! However, in daily life, when using a laptop or tablet to access education, shopping, social media or other sites that provide a service or host a governmental obligation, this shut out a large number of people.
Differences in disability means there is a wide range of incompatibilities that disabled internet users face. People with visual impairments face the challenge of not being able to read off a screen, and navigate their way through a site. 
While others that may have issues with dexterity may find it difficult to move easily within the page which can cause frustration. 
Deaf individuals don't always have access to subtitles on platforms such as YouTube and other video media sites. 
To combat this, when creating websites and other forms of digital interactive platforms, take into account the difficulties that some people may face. Ensuring that deaf people stay connected with subtitles. Blind people have audio guidance throughout sites, and people with challenged motor skills have easier navigation. A lot of these solutions may have to be niche to its own disability as different severities of each disability exist but it is something to think about when creating future digital projects. </p>
<br><br><br>

<h3>2.7</h3>
<p>For the making of a website, you would need an HTML and CSS file. These two conceive the final product into existence, HTML providing the body of content and CSS acting as its boujey outfit, making it appeal to the user. On this website you have hold additional files such as JPEG'S for images, GIF's(moving images) for decorative or informative purposes.
